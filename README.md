# What is this?

Yet another LLD implementation repository (hence, YaLLD).
> Maintainer of this repository has cleared design rounds at interviews from Amazon, Stripe, Booking and Agoda.

# Why is this?

Most of the other repositories hosting LLD interview solutions are either not logical or too verbose which make them unsuited for actual interview rounds spanning 35-45mins of technical part of an interview. The aim of this repository is to host logical and small solutions to LLD questions, which can be implemented partially as well. The implementations try to deploy practical and simple design patterns while driving most of the SOLID principles. For each solution, I will try to provide a separate README with the block diagrams and UML so it can be skimmed.

## Does the code work?

The code is weakly tested, mostly through the happy paths. Rarely in an LLD (not machine coding) round, the code is required to be robust. The non-happy paths may or may not be validated. You can always file an issue and raise a PR.

## I found a bug / improvement

If you find a bug or have an improvisation or want to report an edge case, please file an issue (hopefully alongwith a PR) so this repository can be improved.

# What all will be covered?

The repository tries to cover the niche LLD problems at first, exapnding to non-usual ones. You may, as well, create a milestone for any system which you want to be covered.

# Getting Familiar with LLD

The aim is to cover high-level overview of each design by the means of sequence and block diagrams which can be easily skimmed either when starting off for the first time with LLD or before an interview.

>It might take some time for these diagrams to be uploaded.
